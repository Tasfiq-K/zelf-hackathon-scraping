A grandma, a matriarch in the heart of her village, carving poetry with a scythe in her “batatura,” the courtyard that cradled generations of stories. This wasn’t just about cutting grass; it was an ode to survival etched in every swing of the weathered scythe. An elderly woman, a silhouette against the backdrop of rolling hills and rustic charm, maneuvering a tool almost as ancient as her. The rhythmic cadence of the blade carving through the grass sang a ballad of resilience that transcended the boundaries of time.

In the heart of Romanian villages, where the air is heavy with the tales of survival and shared history, the elders cultivate more than just crops. Our grandma, with her face etched in lines of laughter and wisdom, was a guardian of a fading dialect – the language of resilience, of grit. The scythe, a silent protagonist in this tale, became a bridge connecting the elderly to the present, a tool passed down like an heirloom, carrying the weight of memories in its worn blade.

Wander deep into the untamed heart of the Carpathian wilderness, where the air pulses with the primal vibes of a true king—meet cerbul, the stag. This beast, a living emblem of unbridled beauty, roams Romania’s wild landscapes, casting an ancient spell on those who dare to step into its kingdom. Picture the stag, a majestic silhouette against the backdrop of lush undergrowth, its antlers soaring into the heavens. It moves with the swagger of a guardian of the wild, a noble entity that demands respect with every elegant stride. Witness the spectacle as it sheds and regrows its antlers—a natural show that echoes the rhythmic pulse of these ageless forests. As this majestic creature traverses the rugged terrain, it carries more than just its imposing physicality. It’s a living legend, woven into the very soul of Romania through tales and folklore. The stag isn’t just a symbol of the wild; it embodies resilience, strength, and the delicate interplay between humanity and the wild unknown. Encounters with the cerb forge a connection to the primal spirit of the Carpathian wilderness—a symphony where history’s echoes harmonize with nature’s unyielding grace, creating a rhythm that resonates with every beat of the heart.

TIPS: ✨A room based on 2 people sharing was nearly always cheaper than a hostel (if you can go without aircon, this saves $$ too!) ✨ Buying train tickets are cheaper at the station than online platforms such as 12Go - buy ahead of time to avoid them selling out! ✨ This one’s a given, but opt for local and street food to save pennies ✨ ‘Pickme’ is a very cheap way of getting taxis in Sri Lanka, and any public transport is extremely low cost! ✨ We use ‘Get Nomad’ for our phone data on an eSim - this saves time and effort (compared with local sim) and easy to top up ✨ Lots of places in Sri Lanka charge for foreigners to enter such as parks.

Und vieles hier ist anders, als zuhause in Deutschland, weshalb manches ungewohnt für uns war und wir uns auch in dieser kurzen Zeit nicht dran gewöhnen konnten oder wollten. Hier unsere 3 Dinge, die wir nicht vermissen werden. Nr.1 das Plastik am Strand, auch Sri Lanka ist hiervon nicht verschont geblieben und an vielen Ecken wird Plastikmüll angespült. Leider wird auch beim Einkaufen bzw Alltag noch sehr viel Plastik verbraucht. Nr.2 häufig hatten wir beim Essen Sandkörner zwischen den Zähnen. Wir vermuten, dass es oft von den Frühlingszwiebeln bzw. dem Lauch kam. Das tat schon manchmal beim plötzlichen aufbeißen sehr weh. Nr. 3 die Busse dort waren wirklich verrückt und wir hatten teilweise echt Angst vor ihnen. Sie hupen direkt neben dir als Fußgänger mit völlig übertönten Hupen, das sorgt richtig für Adrenalinausschüttung. Ja so ein Urlaub in einem fremden Land bringt auch neue Erfahrungen und dafür sind wir trotzdem dankbar, auch wenn wir sie definitiv nicht vermissen werden.', 'Do whats best for you!

Aiming to establish a viable population within translocated areas. Our most recent animals for release are our lions.

During a time when gathering in public was severely restricted and cultural expressions like tango and carnival were banned, these brave mothers found a way to protest peacefully. They gathered every Thursday in front of the Casa Rosada, creatively circumventing restrictions by walking arm in arm in circles to demand answers about their disappeared children. Their struggle is a poignant reminder of the power of peaceful protest and the enduring strength of maternal love. Despite facing the same grim fate as their children, the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo remain a symbol of resistance and hope, continuing their demonstrations to this day. Their story is not just history; it's a call to remember the sacrifices made for human rights and justice. Watch the full story and be inspired by their unwavering determination.

Before we had the van, even the cheapest hotels were out of reach thanks to inflated prices, and most of our money went towards taking the train instead of flying. In fact, I can count the holidays I’ve had in the last decade on one hand. Our only real option was the occasional multi-day hike, and even then, much of the time was spent navigating bus routes just to get across the country. One of the things I love the most about travelling in our little home on wheels is that it lets us contribute more directly to local economies. The money we save on accommodation goes to local bookshops, cozy cafés, and the occasional tourist spot to help maintain natural areas. Plus, working remotely means we can schedule our adventures with less hassle and earn money on the road 🚐 We often get questions about wild camping in the van, and yes — it’s totally doable! In our last 6 months of van life, we haven’t stayed at a single campsite. Our strategy during the busier months of the year has been to hike in the mornings whenever we can, and drive in the afternoons to snag the perfect spot before anyone else. Solar power has been pretty much limitless in the summer (though we’re getting more mindful now as autumn sets in), and for water, we just visit campsites on the way and offer a small donation.

Oczywiście medytować możecie☺️, ale chcę przez to powiedzieć, że jest to kraj, który bywa wymagający i intensywny - w pozytywnym tych słów znaczeniu. Organizatorzy podróży do afrykańskich krajów mają tendencję do zastraszania turystów, aby nie podróżowali na własną rękę, A. ze względu na bezpieczeństwo (co jest słuszne), B. przede wszystkim na swoją własną korzyść. Stworzyłam to konto z dwóch głównych przyczyn: 1. Chcę pokazać podróżnikom, którzy już podróżują po świecie na własną rękę, że Kenia również jest przyjaznym krajem do takich wypraw, że da się, nie musi być ultra-drogo, jest bezpiecznie i jest FUN. 2. Chcę promować odpowiedzialne podróżowanie, które nie pomija lokalnych biznesów.

I respected people who practiced it but I didn’t do anything myself. 😢 I always thought things like: ‘How can me giving an airline an extra £2 to offset carbon emissions really help the environment?’ And so I did nothing 🤷\u200d♀️ But this hike really opened my eyes! It was devastating. It was kind of like walking through a haunted forest, completely scarred by the forest fires that ravaged it in summer last year. ☀️ Several of the gorges had be completely closed due to tree fall and many of the hiking trails were surrounded by debris and dead trees. 🌲 These fires needed 400 firefighters to extinguish . Over 1200 hectares of forest was burned and hundreds of people were evacuated. 🔥 Yes, I know that forest fires are a natural part of many ecosystems, playing a crucial role in clearing dead vegetation and allowing new growth to thrive.🌳 But, there’s no denying that human activities, from climate change to careless actions, contribute to the increasing frequency of wildfires. Look at Rhodes this year! And Hawaii! 😭 It made me realize how vital it is for us to protect our natural world. Imagine the impact on the planet if this continues? Imagine if every hike you went on had views like this?😫 So, here are a few ways to practice sustainable travel: - Use efficient modes of transport. Trains are much more environmentally friendly than taxis. 🚊 - Use reusable water bottles. Saves on plastic and it’s just more practical! - Spend in local communities and support local businesses. 💰 - Explore hidden gems. While everyone is rushing off to popular cities or islands, why not try to find hidden gems?

Esto no tiene qué ser así.  Viajar de forma sostenible y consciente implica tomar mejores decisiones, aprovechar al máximo nuestros recursos como el tiempo y el dinero y disfrutar de un destino de tal manera que generemos un mayor valor con nuestra visita. El turismo sostenible puede ser tan divertido, profundo, lujoso y de alta calidad como ustedes quieran. Les comparto 3 formas sencillas en las que podemos viajar de forma más sostenible sin sacrificar valor en nuestros viajes. 1️⃣ Convierte las comidas en experiencias. Cada comida puede convertirse en una experiencia, podemos elegir un hospedaje sin desayuno y en su lugar visitar un mercado o un puesto de comida callejera. No todas las comidas tienen qué ser costosas para que sean memorables, de hecho, casi siempre es lo contrario. 2️⃣ Muévete de forma alternativa. Algunos lugares cuentan medios de transporte muy particulares como mototaxis, bicicletas o botes, transforma un trayecto en una experiencia genuina. Caminar en lugar de pedir un uber siempre nos dejará más experiencias memorables. 3️⃣Conversar. Algunas de las mejores experiencias de viaje se dan al conversar con la gente local, si te aproximas de forma respetuosa, curiosa y con disposición a escuchar y compartir, te llevarás un gran recuerdo, aprendizajes y probablemente esa conversación te lleve a vivir nuevas aventuras', 'Follow me on Instagram as i will stop posting on Tiktok as the algorithm doesnt like my videos.
